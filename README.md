Electric Motor Temperature Prediction Web App


-> Project Description

This project predicts the permanent magnet (PM) temperature of an electric motor using Machine Learning.

The model was trained using motor operational data such as:

Voltage

Current

Motor speed

Coolant temperature

Ambient temperature

The trained model is integrated into a Flask web application, where users can input motor parameters and get predicted temperature instantly.

-> Machine Learning Model

Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor

Feature Scaling: MinMaxScaler

Target Variable: pm (motor temperature in °C)

Final Features Used for Prediction:

1. u_q

2. coolant

3. u_d

4. motor_speed

5. i_d

6. i_q

7. ambient

-> Web Application

The Flask app allows users to:

Enter motor parameters

Click Predict

View predicted motor temperature

-> How to Run the Project
Step 1: Install Required Libraries
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn flask joblib
Step 2: Make Sure These Files Exist

app.py

model.save

transform.save

(If model files are missing, they must be generated by running the training notebook.)

Step 3: Run Flask App
python app.py
